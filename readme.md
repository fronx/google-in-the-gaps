Google In The Gaps
==================

You write a sentence or a fragment and Google fills in the gaps (*) based on search results.

Example:

    $ ruby console.rb "the more we * the less we *"
  
    The More We Know, the Less We Agree
    The More We Learn The Less We Know For Sure - by Ted Sheridan 
    The More We Sprawl, the Less We Move
    The more we Google, the less we know
    The more we awaken, the less we make distinctions
    The more we change stereotypes, the less we will need affirmative action in the future
    The more we communicate, the less we communicate
    The more we communicate, the less we really say
    The more we control, the less we live free
    The more we count, the less we understand
    The more we design, the less we die
    The more we divide ourselves the less we accomplish over silly bickering
    The more we drink the less we feel like thinking
    ...

Have fun.
